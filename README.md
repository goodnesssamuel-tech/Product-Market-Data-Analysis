# Product-Market-Data-Analysis
### 📌 Introduction
Welcome to my **Marketing Analysis Dashboard** — a Power BI project built to uncover *who our customers really are*, *what they love buying*, and *how our marketing efforts are paying off*.  
Think of it as a guided tour inside the mind (and wallet) of our customers 😄.

To bring this to life, I leveraged a mix of data cleaning, exploration and visualization tools to uncover valuable insights.
